> 
> After my obvious immediate reaction, this made me think: what's it like to be Prime Minister such that this could even be an issue? It must be ghastly to be moved from one thing to the next at such a pace and with such a penalty for the slightest slip.
> 
> "It suddenly occurred to me," he replied, "that the Prime Minister might not have been briefed to move the mouse pointer over the link before clicking it." So that's what he'd done: move the mouse pointer so it was definitely pointing at the link.
> 
> "What was the matter?" I asked.
> 
> Eventually news came through that the PM's convoy was nearby. He finally took a deep breath and looked calmly confident. Then he suddenly went slightly green, dashed over to the computer, apparently did nothing, and ran back, sweat beading on his brow.
> 
> The young fast-track civil servant who was in charge of the site was understandably a little nervous about anything going wrong. With an hour to go, everything was ready. Every few minutes he would pop over to the computer and test the sequence again.Launch screen for the 10 Downing Street website press demonstration.
> 
> While Cyber Granny had to click on six things for the show, and was well-rehearsed, Blair had only one task: kick things off by clicking on a link to reveal the site. Here is how the screen looked:
> 
> When Tony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997 my company built the shiny new 10 Downing Street website. The launch event was at a library. The PM would meet the press with a 70-year-old lady nicknamed "Cyber Granny", who was there to show how easy it was to use.
> 
> ### What's it like to be Prime Minister?
> 
> _My friend was a modern historian, and his perspective on this and many other matters of government was informed by his historical knowledge. But whichever way you look at it, that was a phenomenal waste of everyone's time: it achieved nothing other than inconveniencing some people and spending some money. Can this really be (even part of) the best way to provide a counter-balance to government?_
> 
> "The thing is," said my friend, "that being in power is too easy. It is the opposition's job to make it as difficult as possible."
> 
> So in the end the Chief Whip's instruction was calculated simply to inconvenience the government's MPs as much as possible?
> 
> Because, since my friend the opposition MP had the floor, he could have simply talked until the end (which he did), but he_could_have called for a vote at any time. And if he did that, he could have wheeled in any number of MPs to vote with him. If the ruling party could not field a greater number of counter-votes, he would have defeated the government! Therefore, while that pointless "debate" was going on, enough government MPs had to remain to make sure they could defeat an_ad hoc_vote --- and that was the vast majority of them. The entire machinery of the House of Commons also had to keep going for this time.
> 
> Why?
> 
> Why would anyone want to waste time like this? "'By now,' said the Chief Whip, 'the opposition MPs will have called their wives to tell them they'll be home early. This way they'll all have to stay until the end.'"
> 
> In the end, he indeed managed to keep this narrow, pointless topic going for well over two hours until the close of business at 10.30pm.
> 
> "When my turn came up, I launched into a long speech. Look!" He took out a copy of the previous day's_Hansard_. "I spoke from here," and he proudly flipped a couple of densely-printed pages, "to here!" Sure enough, it was uninterrupted waffle for several columns. The speaker tried to bring him round, but even that went on and on ("I thank the honourable gentleman for his sound advice and guidance, and I will sit down after I have finished my final point..."). And his friends joined in, too, even though the topic was only about his constituency.
> 
> "So I rushed around getting some of my other young MP colleagues to come along to help. It was tricky because I had happened to submit a topic about a very specific issue in my constituency."
> 
> "Well, yesterday, mine came up. At around half past five, when it was looking like the day's business would finish a couple of hours early, I bumped into the Chief Whip in the corridor. 'Well done on getting your name in the lottery. Just keep the conversation going for a couple of hours, won't you?' I laughed, but he was deadly serious."
> 
> "Every day there is a lottery. Any MP can put an issue into the hat, and if yours comes up you get the floor at the end of the day, usually for the last half an hour." At the time, this meant 10pm--10.30pm.
> 
> He then told me a story about something that had happened in the chamber the previous day.
> 
> A few months after the start of a parliament I had lunch at Westminster with a friend who had been newly elected as an opposition MP. He told me how rewarding he had been finding his constituency work and gave some examples of how he had already made a difference locally.
> 
> ### Do we do opposition in the best way?
> 
> _In modern government, ministers have the responsibility but none of the expertise. The same is often true in the corporate world; in government the glare of scrutiny seems to make it worse._
> 
> _When did we last have a Secretary of Defence with military experience?_[_Tom King, 1989--92, who at least did National Servic_][1]_e. When did we last have a Secretary of State for Health with medical experience?_[_Walter Elliot, 1938--40, who studied science and medicine and became an army medical officer in World War I_][2]_._
> 
> _Whenever I've told this story, the reaction has been similar: the minister behaved foolishly with his knee-jerk responses. That is certainly how it felt at the time. Later, I wondered whether it was a tactic to filter advice by launching an attack on the advisor and seeing whether he or she crumbles. Clearly that conflates an assessment of the advisor and the advice, but it might be better than nothing._
> 
> And that was that. My civil servant took the action, thanked the minister for his time and we left. They did not, however, make the service in the end.
> 
> The advisors and civil servants around the table mumbled general assent, a little louder this time. Nobody actually said, "Hear, hear!" but you get the idea.
> 
> "This is a brilliant idea. We should definitely do this," he said.
> 
> I thanked the minister for his reaffirming of the brief I had been given and that said that I would finish the walk-through briefly so he could see how it addressed his request. I then carried on with steps two, three and four.
> 
> The dozen advisors and civil servants around the table mumbled general dissatisfaction. Nobody actually said, "Shame!" but you get the idea.
> 
> "I'm going to stop you there. This is a terrible idea. What I want to do is make sure that the public can see who is doing well and who is not. I want to name and shame those that are doing badly."
> 
> After I had done the preamble and one step and was in the middle of explaining step two, the minister interrupted.
> 
> I had kept it brief as requested. I had under a minute of preamble before putting on the screen a prototype of what a member of the public would see and then walking through a scenario. There were three initial steps, and then two more follow-on steps in the story. I also gave the minister a tablet with the same prototype on it.
> 
> At the appointed time we (the senior civil servant and I) were ushered into the room. Expecting to be presenting to the minister, I was surprised to be presenting also to a dozen of his advisors and other civil servants who were not introduced. "My" civil servant was called on. He briefly recapped the original request and why I was there, and then off I went.
> 
> I went along an hour or so early so I could run through it with the civil servant and two of his junior colleagues. Happy with it in principle, we then headed up to the minister's office with half an hour to go. It was quite busy: waiting around outside the office were around ten other people, some of whom went in before we did.
> 
> I was once invited by a senior civil servant to respond to the stated wish of a minister to make a certain group of public servants more publicly accountable for the quality of their work. I was to design a digital service and then go with the civil servant to present it to the minister.
> 
> ### When you are responsible for something of which you are quite ignorant, how do you assess the advice with which you are bombarded?
